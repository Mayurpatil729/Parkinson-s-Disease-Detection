# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

## Overview

Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that impairs movement, leading to symptoms such as shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. These symptoms generally start gradually and worsen over time. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective management and treatment.

This project focuses on predicting Parkinson's disease using machine learning, specifically employing Support Vector Machines (SVM). The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify whether a patient has Parkinson's disease based on their data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains features related to the acoustic properties of voice recordings, which are relevant for diagnosing Parkinson's disease. It includes various attributes that help in distinguishing between individuals with and without the disease.

**Dataset Link:** [Parkinson's Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/naveenkumar20bps1137/parkinson-s-disease-detection-using-ml-algorithms/input)

_Note: Replace the placeholder link with the actual URL of your dataset._

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

   - Data cleaning and normalization.
   - Handling missing values and feature scaling.

2. **Feature Selection:**

   - Identifying the most relevant features for prediction.

3. **Model Training:**

   - Training the SVM model using the dataset.
   - Fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve performance.

4. **Model Evaluation:**

   - Evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Cross-validation to ensure robustness.

5. **Results:**
   - Presenting the modelâ€™s performance metrics and discussing the results.
